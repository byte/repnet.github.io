# RepNet

**"This goes down on your permanent record."**

AI-first reputation intelligence. Evidence-backed. Weekly re-rated. On-chain. Fight-back enabled.

## Overview

RepNet is the behavioral intelligence layer for the digital asset ecosystem. While other platforms focus on tracing money, RepNet specializes in judging character. We build the narrative and investigative record that tracks high-impact actors across rebrands, pivots, and pseudonyms.

## The Problem Scope

$5.6B+ lost to crypto scams in 2023 (estimated $17B+ in 2025, $6.1B+ in Pyramid & Ponzi schemes alone). Serial ruggers rebrand and repeat. Credentials are unverifiable. There is no permanent, intelligent record for people or projects.

- **No Intelligent Record:** Ethos is Yelp for X accounts. Intuition stores attestations but won't judge. Nothing currently thinks about reputation.
- **Reputation Laundering:** Bad actors rebrand, spin fresh wallets, and pivot narratives. No AI connects the dots across identities and wallets.
- **Unverifiable Credentials:** "Former Google, former NASA" — nobody checks. No system cross-references claims against evidence at scale.
- **Manual Heroes Don't Scale:** ZachXBT ratios scammers single-handedly. We give every wallet a ZachXBT that never sleeps — an AI that reads, connects, and rates.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Evidence:** Multi-LLM ingestion of on-chain and social signals.
2.  **Dossiers:** Automated behavioral mapping of individual actors and projects.
3.  **Council (Multi-LLM Jury):** Unlike single-model systems, we use a jury of independent LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and other frontier models) to evaluate evidence. A specialized "Foreperson" model aggregates verdicts to prevent bias and hallucination.
4.  **Anchors:** On-chain evidence hashing for permanent, tamper-proof records.
5.  **Fight-Back:** Structured dispute and resolution mechanisms for subjects to challenge findings.

## Live Intelligence

RepNet is scaling its intelligence repository and infrastructure. Dossiers are generated based on public data and model-driven synthesis.
